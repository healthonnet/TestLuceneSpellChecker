Test Lucene Spell Checker
=========================

Loads terms and frequencies for an arbitrary corpus into a local MySQL database, builds a Lucene index on the terms, and and then allows you to test its spell checking abilities against the index.

Sort of a "Hello World" grails app for me (Nolan).
